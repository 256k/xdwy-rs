# XdwY
*X days without Y*

When i was quitting smoking/vaping, one thing that really helped me stay motivated was seeing how many days had gone by without me smoking.
Everytime i would look at the app, the number would increase and i would be even more motivated to keep going.

I got inspired by this idea and i wanted to apply this motivation tool with other things.
So i decided to build a very simple and generic tool that counts the days that have passed without doing Y (anything you want)

// NOTE: i will most likely be changing this in the future to XdsY [ X days since Y ] which would be more generic and i think a lil catchier.

this is a WIP, I'm using this idea as a learning path towards learning Rust.
